# SolarSystem###A game in the solar system ;)![begin image](/img/begin.jpg)**About the game:**There are two player in the solar system. They both have a spatial vessel that can shoot bullets. But be careful, the gravity is acting, and can modify you trajectory!Will you get the higher score?**About technical aspect:**We first made a "perfect model", but the planets moved too slow to make it interesting. Thus, we accelerate them, even if in the physics, it doesn't make sense. The planets were automatically downloadedAs we wanted to be as close as possible form the real physics situation, we scrap the position of the planets for their initial position. Therefore, the game is different each day! :D**This game depends on:*** Python 3* pygame* math* sys* bs4* re* requests* selenium* time Build with <3 by Octavio, Sorin, & Paul
